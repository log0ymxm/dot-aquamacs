This is an aquamacs config based largely off of emacs-starter-kit functions and a handful of necessary configs

Install aquamacs by visiting http://aquamacs.org/

Install these configs to your mac user home directory by running 
    install.sh

If you make any updates to your emacs configs use update.sh to update this git repository & push the changes back upstream
